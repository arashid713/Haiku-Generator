# Haiku-Generator
Welcome to the Haiku Generator! This simple Python script generates haikus based on your mood or theme. Whether you're feeling love, anger, or longing, this tool provides a poetic escape through traditional Japanese verse.

# Features
Mood-Based Haikus: Choose from themes like LOVE, ANGER, NATURE, SORROW, LONGING, NOSTALGIA, REGRET, and FORGIVENESS to receive a haiku that matches your current feeling.
Random Selection: Each theme contains multiple haikus, and one is randomly selected for you every time you make a request.
Interactive Interface: The script runs in a loop, allowing you to input different moods or exit the program by typing "quit."

# How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the script using Python.
Input a mood from the list of available themes or type "quit" to exit the program.
Enjoy your personalized haiku!
